## Running the Application

The application now successfully imports all required modules. To run it on a system with a display server:

```bash
# Using the Python script
python run.py

# Using the shell script (Linux/Mac)
./start.sh
```

Default login:
- Admin: admin@library.com / admin123

## Development Notes

- The application uses a modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- All imports now use absolute paths from the project root to avoid dependency issues
- Error handling is implemented at multiple levels
- The UI is responsive and designed for different screen sizes
